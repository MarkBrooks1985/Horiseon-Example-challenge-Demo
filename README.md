CSS Demo Site
## Description

The Project CSS Demo Site is an example of my budding skills of CSS in regards to debugging webpages that have not been code one hundred percent concise. I was motivated in doing this project by the desire to learn more about coding languages eg. HTML and CSS. In this projtect I solved a couple of issues including sectioning off aspects of the page and fixing various elements to do with padding and margins to correct the alignments of elements of the page. I also made sure that no sections had a H2, H3 tag without a H1 first as it is important to have those in numerical order. During this project I learnt more about padding and margin tags and their uses.
